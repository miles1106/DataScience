Goal:

this data set contains hourly Minneapolis-St Paul, MN traffic volume for westbound I-94, it also includes weather and holiday features from 2012-2018.
Your company wants to define a model to predict the traffic volume, given the current period of the year, and weather conditions, because this impacts
the delivery time in the company. Being able to predict when the traffic volume is above 1.5 std from the mean volume, would allow the company to save
1000 dollars per correct prediction, versus a cost of 100 dollar per false prediction.
